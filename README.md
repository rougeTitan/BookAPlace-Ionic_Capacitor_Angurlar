<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Ionic is one of the most exciting technologies you can learn at the moment - it enables you to use one codebase (written in HTML, JS and CSS) to build and ship apps as normal (progressive) web apps as well as real native mobile apps for iOS and Android.

Angular (formerly Angular 2) allows you to create awesome web applications powered by TypeScript / JavaScript.

The Ionic framework allows you to use your existing Angular, HTML, JS and CSS knowledge and build your native mobile app with that! Ionic offers a lot of beautiful components  that can be used to compose native-like user interfaces.

Capacitor (another tool provided by the Ionic team) will handle the rest as it's used to then build a native mobile app for iOS/ Android based on your code. This allows you to focus on the things you know and release your application on all possible devices (desktop and mobile) without having to learn thousands of different languages!

This project is created to presnet my skills through a demo application built with Angular, Ionic ( with Capacitore) and Google Firebase. This application coveres all the major angular concepts that are required to build industry level web, IOS and Android application,

* Component
* Module
* Pages
* Services & Dependency Injection
* Routing
* Observable
* Handling Forms
* Pipes 
* Making HTTP Requests
* Authentication & Route Protection
* Error Handling
